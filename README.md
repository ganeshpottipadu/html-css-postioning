# html-css-postioning
This code creates a blue rectangular box (`blue-box`) with a red circle (`red-circle`) inside it. Both use `position: relative`, which shifts the blue box 200px down and 200px right from its original spot in the browser window. The red circle is then positioned 150px down and 250px right inside the blue box, keeping their relative alignment.
